    "Cleaning data is an important part of a data scientist's work cycle. As you have already seen, the data we will be analyzing in P10 and P11 has been split up into 15 different files of different formats. Even worse, as you shall see later in this project, some of these files have been corrupted, and lots of data is missing. Unfortunately, in the real world, a lot of data that you will come across will be in rough shape, and it is your job to clean it up before you can analyze it. In P10, you will combine the data in these different files to create a few manageable data structures, which can be easily analyzed. In the process, you will also have to deal with broken CSV files (by skipping rows with broken data), and broken JSON files (by skipping the files entirely).\n",

    "\n",
    "Our function `get_planets` works very well so far. However, it is likely that it will not work on all the files in the `data` directory. For example, if you use the function `get_planets` to read the data in `planets_4.csv` and `mapping_4.json`, you will most likely run into an error. **Try it yourself to verify!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason your code likely crashed is because there the file `planets_4.csv` is **broken**. For some reason, several rows in `planets_4.csv` have their data jumbled up. For example, in the **seventh** row of `planets_4.csv`, we come across this row:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Planet Name|Discovery Method|Discovery Year|Controversial Flag|Orbital Period [days]|Planet Radius [Earth Radius]|Planet Mass [Earth Mass]|Orbit Semi-Major Axis [au]|Eccentricity|Equilibrium Temperature [K]|Insolation Flux [Earth Flux]|\n",
    "|-----------|----------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|\n",
    "123.01000000|Radial Velocity|2009|0|61 Vir d|5.110|22.90000|0.476000|0.350000||\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that for some reason, the value under the column `Planet Name` is a **number** while the value under the column `Orbital Period [days]` is a **string**. It is possible that these two columns of data got *swapped* here, but we cannot be sure about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call such a **row** in a CSV file where the values under a column do not match the expected format to be a **broken row**. While it is possible to sometimes extract useful data from broken rows, in this project, we will simply **skip** broken rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "You **must** now go back to your definition of `get_planets` and edit it, so that any **broken rows get skipped**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The simplest way to recognize if a row is broken is if you run into any **RunTime Errors** when you call the `get_planets` function. So, one simple way to skip bad rows would be to use `try/except` blocks to avoid processing any rows that cause the code to crash; remember **not** to use *bare* `try/except` blocks.\n",
    "2. There are only **10** broken rows in `planets_4.csv`, and they are all **bunched up** at the very beginning and the very end of the dataset. You can manually **inspect** the **first 10 and last 10** rows, and figure out which of these rows are broken and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Warning:** You are **not** allowed to **hardcode** the indices of the broken rows. You may inspect `planets_4.csv` to identify how to tell a **broken row** apart. Therefore, to use the example of the **broken row** above, you **may not** hardcode to skip the **seventh** row of `planets_4.csv`. However, it is **acceptable** to make your function **skip** any row for which the value under the `Planet Name` is not numeric, by observing that this is the reason why the row is broken."
