If you open your `.csv` files with Excel, manually count through the rows and use this number to loop through the dataset, this is also considered as hardcoding. If any instances of hardcoding are found during code review, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score.\n",

If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public test score, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.\n",

    "- `star_cell`\n",
    "- `get_stars`\n",
    "- `planet_cell`\n",
    "- `get_planets`\n",
    "- `plot_scatter`\n",

    "In this project, you will also be required to define certain **data structures**. If you do not create these data structures exactly as specified, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public test score, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required Data Structures:\n",
    "- `Star` (**namedtuple**)\n",
    "- `stars_dict` (**dictionary** mapping **strings** to `Star` objects)\n",
    "- `Planet` (**namedtuple**)\n",

    "- `star_classes` (**dictionary**)\n",
    "- `all_planets_list` (**list** of `Planet` objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you are also **required** to follow the requirements below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You **must** never use the output of the `os.listdir` function directly. You **must** always first remove all files and directories that start with `\".\"`, and **explicitly sort** the list before doing anything with it.\n",
    "* You are **not** allowed to use **modules** like `pandas` to answer the questions in this project.\n",
    "* You **must** properly **label** the axes of all your **plots**.\n",
    "* Do **not** define multiple functions with the same name or define multiple versions of one function with different names. Just keep the best version.\n",
    "* Do **not** leave in irrelevant output or test code that we didn't ask for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score.\n",

    "### Stellar Evolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Stellar Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution) is a description of the way that stars change with time. The primary factor determining how a star evolves is its `stellar_mass`. Depending on the `stellar_mass` of each `Star`, astronomers can predict how the `Star` will end up. A `Star` whose `stellar_mass` is $\\geq 0.3$ and $< 8$ times the mass of the Sun will become a [Red Giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant), while a `Star` whose `stellar_mass` is $\\geq 8$ and $< 10.5$ times the mass of the Sun will become a [White Dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf). A `Star` that is even bigger will end up as a [Neutron Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star)."

    "### Data Structure 1: `star_classes`\n",
    "\n",
    "You **must** now classify the `Star` objects in `stars_dict` using their `stellar_mass`. You **must** create a **dictionary** `star_classes` with the **keys**: `Red Giant`, `White Dwarf`, and `Neutron Star`. The **value** of each **key** must be a **list** of **strings** containing the **names** of the `Star` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "You **must** **ignore** `Star` objects for which we do not have `stellar_mass` data or have `stellar_mass` **less** than *0.3* Solar masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Recall that the `stellar_mass` data already uses units of *Solar masses*. So, a `stellar_mass` of *1* means that the `Star` object has the same mass as the Sun, and a `stellar_mass` of 2 means the `Star` object has twice the mass of the Sun, and so on."

    "The [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram) is a scatter plot of stars showing the relationship between the stars' `stellar_luminosity` versus their `stellar_effective_temperature`. The diagram is exceedingly useful for understanding the stellar evolution of stars. We will now use the data we have available to plot this diagram ourselves, so we can better understand stellar evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to plot the `stellar_effective_temperature` against the `stellar_luminosity`, but more importantly, we will use the **color** and **size** parameters to represent the `stellar_age` and `stellar_mass` of the `Star` objects as well. This will allow us to see the effects of `stellar_age` and `stellar_mass` on `stellar_effective_temperature` and `stellar_luminosity`."

    "The temperature on the surface of the planet is another important criteria for deciding whether a planet is habitable. The `equilibrium_temperature` of a `Planet` is the temperature that the planet would be, if it were a [black body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body) (i.e., if it were able to absorb all the radiation it receives from its host star). However, most planets are not perfect black bodies and reflect some of the radiation that they receive from their host star. Astronomers use the quantity [albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo) to measure how much radiation is reflected by the planet. An albedo of *0* implies that the planet is a perfect black body which absorbs all its radiation, while an albedo of *1* implies that the planet is perfectly reflective, and does not retain any radiation. In the real world, most planets have an albedo value between *0* and *0.5*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we do **not** have the albedo values of the `Planet` objects in our dataset. So, we will instead make some educated guesses and find the **maximum** and **minimum** surface temperatures, assuming that the albedo is within the range of *0* to *0.5* (which is known to be the case for most planets)."
